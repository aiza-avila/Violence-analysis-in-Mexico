# Violence-analysis-in-Mexico
Comparative analysis of Mexico's impact on violence after the 4T  administration


The objective of this dashboard is to visualize the evolution of the indices of violence comparing the evolution of reported crimes from 2015 until 2023.
This analysis is made also comparing each State of the Republic to spot if there are any regions where the violence has increased/decreased.

Main objectives are:
*  Identify how has the amount of reported crimes evolved vs. the current perception of society on 
the levels of crime?
* Idetnify why do citizens not report crimes?

The proposed dashboard aims to be an interactive display of the States of the Mexican Republic, using a heat map that shows a more intense color as the State experiences more cases of violence. It is possible through a slicer to see the evolution of reported cases, as well as to identify at national or state level the top reported crimes.

In some graphs I make the direct comparison between 2018 and 2023 since it's the period of presidency that I'm interested in analyze

## Results

* The results seem to indicate that cases of violence have not decreased, but rather the opposite.
* Mexican society is still unwilling to report crimes because the process is a waste of time and we do not trust the authorities.
* There are some states that do not present this phenomenon (such as Chiapas)
* Security figures show an increase in the number of cases, it seems that the general response of the survey is that the population feels safer
